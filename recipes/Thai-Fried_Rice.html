    <ol>
        <li>
            In a medium pot cook jasmine rice 
            according to package directions,
            usually the rice to water ratio is 1 cup rice :
             1½ cups water.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl add the soy sauce,
            fish sauce, sugar, and white pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat. 
            Add the peanut and canola oil and let the oil 
            heat up a little, about 30 seconds. 
            Then add the garlic, ginger, chilis, 
            and half of the green onions. 
            Cook for 2 minutes, or until everything is 
            fragrant and the garlic is a just starting to 
            lightly brown. Add the shallots 
            and fry until they start to turn translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add all your cooked rice 
            (it should be around 3 cups cooked). 
            Toss altogether. 
            Then pour all the sauce over the rice. 
            Continue to toss the rice and 
            let all the ingredients fry together 
            for 1 – 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Push all the rice to one side of the pan to 
            make space to fry the egg. 
            Crack an egg on the other side of the pan 
            and mix the egg to scramble. 
            Add a pinch of salt and black pepper to the egg. 
            Fry the egg just before it is done cooking all the way. 
            Then toss the rice in with the egg, 
            the other half of green onions, 
            and Thai basil to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can dish it up with some cilantro 
            and cucumber slices. Enjoy!
